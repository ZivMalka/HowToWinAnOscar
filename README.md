# HowToWinAnOscar


## Motivation & Overview  
A system that can predict whether or not a movie will win an Oscar using AI algorithms.

This project checks whether certain features have an impact of winning an Oscar. for example: awards show (Golden Globe, BAFTA awards, and guild), IMDb score, critics score, running time, release date and etc. I focused on the best picture category.

The dataset was taken from an open source project called "And-the-Oscar-goes-to". It contains 218 observations of all the Oscars candidates and winners since 1980.
