# HowToWinAnOscar


## Motivation & Overview  

We were asked to write a project in Dot Net and MongoDB. The demand was to create a system with several collections. I decided to step it up a notch and use a decision tree that can predict whether a movie will win an Oscar or not.

I wanted to see whether certain features have an impact of winning an Oscar, features such as other awards show (like Golden Globe, BAFTA awards, and guild), IMDb score, critics score, running time, release date and etc. I focused on the best picture category.

The data was taken from an open source project called "And-The-Oscar-goes-to".
The data included all the candidates and Oscar winners since 1980 meaning I had 218 observations.
