<h2 class="t3">The Report</h2>

<p>
    To predict whether a film would win an Oscar or not, To predict whether a film would win an Oscar or not, I used Random forests or random decision forests.<br />
    Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, <br />
    that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is <br />
    the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. <br />
    Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set (from wikipedia).
</p>

<p>
    options, such as a decision tree  C45 algorithm. C4.5 is an extension of Quinlan's earlier ID3 algorithm.
    The decision trees generated by C4.5 can be used for classification, and for this reason,
    C4.5 is often referred to as a statistical classifier.
</p>

<p>
    Since these algorithms can predict more than one winner a year, or none winner a year, I used the Logistic Regression, <br />
    which chose the film with the highest probability of winning among those that the algorithm predicted as winners. <br />
    In case no winner is selected, he will choose the film with the highest probability of winning. <br />
</p>

<p>
    To calculate the accuracy of the algorithm, i used a confusion matrix(by Accord.Net Framework). 
    In each iteration i examined the accuracy of each year. Then I cursed the results.
</p>

<h2>Here are the results</h2>

<br />
<br />
<p>
    You can see that the results of the algorithms are almost identical and there is no significant difference.<br />
  <h2>Does the time affect the outcome? </h2> 
    <br /> I reduced the size of the data and chose the years between 2006 and 2016
</p>

<p>
   As you can see, the results are better, after i have reduced the range of the years.<br />
    This can be related  to the fact that times have changed.  <br />
    Films that have won in the past, were not sure to win today.
    <b> the accuracy now is 84% for C45, and 85% for Random Forest.</b> 
</p>

<h2>Cross Validation </h2>
<p>
    I was still not sure whether our calculation of the accuracy was correct, <br />
    and that is precisely the accuracy of the algorithm.<br />
    Therefore i estimate the performance of the decision tree model <b>using cross-validation.</b><br />
    here are the results:

<p>
    You can see the results are no different from previous results. <br />
